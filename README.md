# sofamyroom

This project proposes a fast, accurate, and flexible "shoebox" room acoustics simulator that supports both specular and diffuse reflections.
The simulator extends the work released by Schimmel et al., called Roomsim, by adding the rendering of Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIR) using arbitrary Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) stored with the AES Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics (SOFA) file format. Moreover, SofaMyRoom can be launched directly from your console of choice.

## Python version

The version available in this branch adds Python bindings instead of MATLAB. It has been developed by Prerak Srivastava and Manuel Pariente under the supervision of Antoine Deleforge.
