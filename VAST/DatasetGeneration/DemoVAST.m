% This script initialize a VAST structure with common parameters (sample
% frequency, sizes, ...) and build the rest of the structure to reproduce
% one of the conditions of the paper.
% At the end of the computation the VAST structure and the BRIR are saved into
% VAST.mat 
% If you want to save the BRIR into a set of WAVE file change the SaveWAV
% variable from false to true. 
% The functions SubVASTGeneration is an example on how it is possibile to
% populate the VAST structure.
